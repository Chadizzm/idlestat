Introduction
------------

The purpose of idlestat is to measure how long we have been in the different
idle and operating states.

Idlestat uses kernel's FTRACE function to monitor and capture C-state and
P-state transitions of CPUs over a time interval. It extracts the following
information from trace file:
	- Times when CPUs entered and exited a certain C-state
	- Times when CPUs entered and exited a certain P-state
	- Raised IRQs

Following a successful run, idlestat calculates and reports the following
information:
	- Total, average, minimum and maximum time spent in each C-state,
	per-CPU.
	- Total, average, minimum and maximum time spent in each P-state,
	per-CPU.
	- Total, average, minimum and maximum time during which all CPUs in
	a cluster were in the same C-state, per-cluster.
	- Number of times a certain IRQ caused a CPU to exit idle state,
	per-CPU and per-IRQ

Requirements
------------

1. It must be run as root in order to access /sys/kernel/debug.
2. It requires tracing to be enabled in the kernel

Example Usage
-------------

./idlestat -d -o myoutput -t 10

where,

-d : dump the states at the end
-o : output file to store the traces
-t : the duration in seconds
